# TO DO

## Sorted by priority (most->least)

* Interpreted by line-by-line meaning you can't do things like
  append a comment to the end of code or have more than code
  on one line and must instead use a newline to

* Cannot use custom variable notation (e.g. should be `$@array`
  instead of `${array[@]}`) because of how compilation is
  currently done

* There's probably lots more that haven't be discovered yet
